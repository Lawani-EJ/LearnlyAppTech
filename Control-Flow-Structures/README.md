# Control structures and Control flow

## Control flow
- Control flow is the order in which statements are executed in a program
- By default the control flow is for statements to be read and executed in order from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

## Control statements
- control statements are statements that are used to determine the flow of control in a program.
- They enable conditional executions such as looping and branching, allowing the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on various conditions.

```javascript
    let a = 5;
    if(a === 5){
        console.log("a is equal to 5");
    }else{
        console.log("a is not equal to 5");
    }
```
